## NO TENTS & NOT IN BARRHAVEN

[Download PDF](/flyer-brass.pdf)

## What you need to know

The city is considering 1025 Greenbank Road at the intersection of Highbury Park & Greenbank, as one of two potential sites for a shelter to house asylum seekers.

If no longer needed for that purpose, it could be converted into an overflow shelter for unhoused individuals.

A second site between Woodroffe Avenue and the Nepean Woods Park & Ride is also being assessed.

An independent engineering firm is currently evaluating both sites, with a report due to be shared with City Council by the end of October or early November.

## You must have the same concerns or even more

- **Lack of Transparency with the Process**: No full list of properties under consideration and the scoring matrix has been released yet. Our voices have not been heard!

- **Capacity and Turnover Raising Safety and Resource Concerns**: The proposed tent facility is designed to accommodate 150 single adult asylum seekers at any given time, indicating a regular inflow and outflow of individuals, raising serious concerns about the safety and limited public resources in our community.

- **Long-term Viability**: There is no adequate housing available in Ottawa for them after their cases are processed. They need a home, not a tent.

- **Duration of Presence**: The Sprung Shelter will remain in place for 25-40 years. This Highbury Park location is in the heart of Barrhaven and must be used for the expedient development of high-density, transit-oriented homes.

- **There Must Be a Better Solution for Asylum Seekers** with a long-term strategy for their life in Canada. A location closer to government offices, medical services, social services, transportation, and occupational activities for them (specifically for single male asylum seekers) is required.

- We believe additional sites and other type of housing project than tent shelter should be considered by all level of government. For example, many Federal buildings available for housing projects are detailed in the Public lands mapping tool: [https://experience.arcgis.com](https://experience.arcgis.com).
