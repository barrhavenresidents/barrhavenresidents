If no longer needed for that purpose, it could be converted into an overflow shelter for unhoused individuals.  A second site between Woodroffe Avenue and the Nepean Woods Park &amp; Ride is also being assessed.  An independent engineering firm is currently evaluating both sites, with a report due to be shared with City Council by the end of October or early November.

Our voices have not been heard! Capacity and Turnover Raising Safety and Resource Concerns: The proposed tent facility is designed to accommodate 150 single adult asylum seekers at any given time, indicating a regular inflow and outflow of individuals, raising serious concerns about the safety and limited public resources in our community. Long-term Viability: There is no adequate housing available in Ottawa for them after their cases are processed. They need a home, not a tent. Duration of Presence: The Sprung Shelter will remain in place for 25-40 years. This Highbury Park location is in the heart of Barrhaven and must be used for the expedient development of high-density, transit-oriented homes. There Must Be a Better Solution for Asylum Seekers with a long-term strategy for their life in Canada. A location closer to government offices, medical services, social services, transportation, and occupational activities for them (specifically for single male asylum seekers) is required.
